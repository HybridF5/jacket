"""Defines interface for DB access.

Functions in this module are imported into the compute.db namespace. Call these
functions from compute.db namespace, not the compute.db.api namespace.

All functions in this module return objects that implement a dictionary-like
interface. Currently, many of these objects are sqlalchemy objects that
implement a dictionary interface. However, a future goal is to have all of
these objects be simple dictionaries.
